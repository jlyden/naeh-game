Current game details storage:
 - board_list_pickle (game) - strings?
 - record (record) - game_id, round_count, board_name, beads_in, beads_out, end_count (for round), note (major decisions)
 - log (log) - game_id, round_count, board_played (string), moves (pickle of strings with counts for each move)


Plans:
 - Use BOARD_NAMES when names needed in UI, but change BOARD_LIST to numbers only (refs to BOARD_NAMES).
 - new table: Stats - game_id, round_count, from_board(int), to_board(int), beads_moved
