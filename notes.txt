Need ways to
 - show more clearly in UI that a new program has been added
 - show in UI when a program has ended (b/c changed to different program)
 - remove from round play the program that has ended
  -- this includes that board's turn
  -- plus "send anywhere" criteria

There are two currently static lists:
 - BOARD_LIST, to display/verify round play
 - ANYWHERE_LIST, to determine send_anywhere destination

 - use dict to determine next board to play
 - remove boards/methods from dict if transformed

dispatcher = {'Intake': play_intake, 'Emergency': play_emergency, 'rapid': play_rapid, 'outreach': play_outreach, 'transitional': play_transitional, 'permanent': play_permanent}

dispatcher['Intake']()
dispatcher.pop('transitional')
